    "# Example of FaIRv2.1\n",
    "\n",
    "FaIR v2.1 is object-oriented and designed to be more flexible than its predecessors. This does mean that setting up a problem is different to before - gone are the days of 60 keyword arguments to `fair_scm` and we now use hierarchical classes with fewer arguments that in the long run should be easier to use. Of course, there is a learning curve, and will take some getting used to. This tutorial aims to walk through a simple problem using FaIR 2.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of FaIR 2.1 centres around the `FAIR` class, which contains all information about the scenario(s), the forcer(s) we want to investigate, and any configurations specific to each species and the response of the climate.\n",
    "\n",
    "A run is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "fair = FAIR(scenarios, configs, time, run_config)\n",
    "fair.run()\n",
    "\n",
    "# results are stored within fair, and can be obtained such as\n",
    "print(fair.temperature)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple `scenarios` and `configs` can be supplied in each run of FaIR, and due to internal parallelisation is the fastest way to run the model. The total number of scenarios that will be run is the product of `scenarios` and `configs`. For example we might want to run three emissions `scenarios` -- let's say SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0 -- using climate calibrations (`configs`) from the UKESM, GFDL, MIROC and NorESM climate models. This would give us a total of 3$\\times$4 = 12 ensemble members in total which are run in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most difficult part to learning FaIR 2.1 is correctly defining the `scenarios` and `configs`, and allows for a lot of flexibility. In this tutorial the recommended order in which to define a problem is set out."

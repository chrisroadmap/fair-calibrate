    Calculate greenhouse-gas time constant scaling factor.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cumulative_emissions : ndarray
        GtC cumulative emissions since pre-industrial.
    airborne_emissions : ndarray
        GtC total emissions remaining in the atmosphere.
    temperature : ndarray or float
        K temperature anomaly since pre-industrial.
    iirf_0 : ndarray
        pre-industrial time-integrated airborne fraction.
    iirf_cumulative : ndarray
        sensitivity of time-integrated airborne fraction with atmospheric
        carbon stock.
    iirf_temperature : ndarray
        sensitivity of time-integrated airborne fraction with temperature
        anomaly.
    iirf_airborne : ndarray
        sensitivity of time-integrated airborne fraction with airborne
        emissions.
    g0 : ndarray
        parameter for alpha TODO: description
    g1 : ndarray
        parameter for alpha TODO: description
    iirf_max : float
        maximum allowable value to time-integrated airborne fraction

    Notes
    -----
    Where array input is taken, the arrays always have the dimensions of

    retain the singleton dimension in order to preserve clarity of
    calculation and speed.
